          <p>CNVRS is a mobile application for iPhone and Android by CNVRS, LLC. The application as a whole and all rights, titles, and interests in and to the application are owned by CNVRS, LLC. These terms were last updated on July 1st, 2013 and the CNVRS team reserves the right to change and update them without warning or notification.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your access to and use of CNVRS, including any CNVRS mobile applications and websites (the "<strong>Services</strong>"),
 and any videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials 
uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred
 to as "<strong>Content</strong>"). Your access to and use of the 
Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these 
Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these
 Terms.</p>

<h3>1. Basic Terms</h3>

<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you
 post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you
 submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of 
the Services and through third party services and websites. You should 
only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under 
these Terms.</p>

<p>You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with
 CNVRS and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws
 of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are 
accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, 
organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and 
warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only 
in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, 
national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>

<p>The Services that CNVRS provides are always evolving and the form and 
nature of the Services that CNVRS provides may change from time to time 
without prior notice to you. In addition, CNVRS may stop (permanently or 
temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the 
Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide 
you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use 
and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to 
you.</p>

<p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the
 Content or information on the Services, queries made through the 
Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by 
CNVRS on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for CNVRS 
granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that CNVRS and 
its parent, third party providers and partners may place such 
advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content
 or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>

<h3>2. Privacy</h3>

<p>Any information that you provide to CNVRS is subject to our <a href="http://cnvrs.com/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
 which governs our collection and use of your information. You 
understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the 
collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this 
information, including the transfer of this information to the United 
States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by CNVRS. 
As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with 
certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative
 messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and 
your CNVRS account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>

<h3>3. Passwords</h3>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that
 you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under 
your account. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that
 use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols)
 with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your 
CNVRS account (such as Twitter, Facebook, or your email). CNVRS cannot and will not 
be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply 
with the above requirements.</p>

<h3>4. Content on the Services</h3>

<p>All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the
 sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, 
but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the 
Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or 
reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained
 by you through the Services is at your own risk.</p>

<p>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, 
truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications 
posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the 
Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed 
to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise 
inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or 
are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will CNVRS be liable in 
any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or 
omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a
 result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or 
otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.</p>

<h3>5. Your Rights</h3>

<p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on 
or through the Services. In order to make the Services available to you 
and other users, CNVRS needs a license from you. By submitting, posting 
or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a 
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to 
sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, 
transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or 
distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>

<p>You agree that this license includes the right for CNVRS to provide, 
promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or 
through the Services available to other companies, organizations or 
individuals who partner with CNVRS for the syndication, broadcast, 
distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services,
 subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such 
additional uses by CNVRS, or other companies, organizations or 
individuals who partner with CNVRS, may be made with no compensation paid
 to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or 
otherwise make available through the Services.</p>

<p>We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or 
distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make 
changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that 
Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, 
services or media. For example, if you choose to share Content through 
your connected Twitter account, we will adapt your Content so that it 
can be attached to a Tweet in a Twitter card.</p>

<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you
 provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your 
Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that
 your Content may be syndicated, broadcast, distributed, or published by
 our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for 
such use, it may subject you to liability. CNVRS will not be responsible 
or liable for any use of your Content by CNVRS in accordance with these 
Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and
 authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content 
that you submit.</p>

<h3>6. Your License to Use the Services</h3>

<p>CNVRS gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable

enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by
 CNVRS, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>

<h3>7. CNVRS Rights</h3>

<p>All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding 
Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of
 CNVRS and its licensors. The Services are protected by copyright,

<h3>8. Restrictions on Content and Use of the Services</h3>

<p>We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) 
to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services and to 
suspend terminate users or reclaim usernames without liability to you. 
You may not post Content that:
<ul><li>Impersonates another person or entity in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others;</br><br>
  </li><li>Violates the rights of a third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, and publicity rights; <br><br>
  </li><li>Is a direct and specific threat of violence to others; <br><br>
  </li><li>Is furtherance of illegal activities; or<br><br>
  </li><li>Is harassing, abusive, or constitutes spam. </li></ul>
</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
 information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any 
applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) 
enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations 
hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or 
technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect 
the rights, property or safety of CNVRS, its users and the public. CNVRS 
does not disclose personally identifying information to third parties 
except in accordance with our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the 
Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the 
Services, CNVRS computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of 
the providers of CNVRS; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any 
system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication
 measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the 
Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our 
currently available, published interfaces that are provided by CNVRS (and
 only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been 
specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with CNVRS (NOTE: 
crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the 
provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services 
without the prior consent of CNVRS is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge 
any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any 
email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, 
deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere 
with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or
 network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, 
flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the 
creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an 
undue burden on the Services.</p>

<h3>9. Copyright Policy</h3>

<p>CNVRS respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects 
users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of 
alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are 
properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been 
copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide 
us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic 
signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their 
behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
 infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be 
infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
 removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information 
reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your 
contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an 
email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief 
that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized 
by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that
 the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of 
perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright 
owner.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing 
without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate 
circumstances, CNVRS will also terminate a user's account if the user is 
determined to be a repeat infringer. </p>

<h3>10. Ending These Term</h3>

<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or CNVRS as follows.</p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with CNVRS at any time for any reason
 by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the 
Services. In order to deactivate your account, please <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you 
with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, 
but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated 
these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or 
(iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially 
viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email 
address associated with your account or through the Services the next 
time you attempt to access your account.</p>

<p>In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without 
limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following 
sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.</p>

or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided 
above in section 1.</p>

<h3>11. Limitations of Liability</h3>

CNVRS and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies,

licensors (collectively, the "<strong>CNVRS Entities</strong>"). Each of 
the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted 
under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of 
implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a
 result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in

Services will meet your requirements or be available on an 
uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, 
whether oral or written, obtained from CNVRS Entities or through the

 THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT 
YOU PAID CNVRS, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING 
RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CNVRS ENTITIES HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A 
REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL 
PURPOSE.</p>

<h3>12. General Terms</h3><br>

<h4>A. Waiver and Severability</h4>

<p>The failure of CNVRS to enforce any right or provision of these Terms 
will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event 
that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the 
minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms 
will remain in full force and effect.</p><br>

<h4>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the 
laws of the State of Indiana without regard to or application of its 
conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All 
claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the 
Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located 
in St. Joseph County, Indiana, United States, and you consent to 
the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as 
to inconvenient forum.</p>

<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United
 States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable 
to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then
 those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government 
entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by
 the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict
 of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted
 under federal law, the laws of the State of Indiana (excluding 
choice of law).</p><br>

<h4>C. Entire Agreement</h4>
<p>These Terms and our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>

agreement with CNVRS that is explicitly in addition or in place of these 
Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements 
between CNVRS and you regarding the Services.</p>
